    Algorithm: 

      Let the given graph be G. Add a new vertex s to the graph, add edges from the new vertex to all vertices of G. Let the modified graph be G’. 
      Run the Bellman-Ford algorithm on G’ with s as the source. Let the distances calculated by Bellman-Ford be h[0], h[1], .. h[V-1]. If we find a negative weight cycle, then return. Note that the negative weight cycle cannot be created by new vertex s as there is no edge to s. All edges are from s. 
      Reweight the edges of the original graph. For each edge (u, v), assign the new weight as “original weight + h[u] – h[v]”. 
      Remove the added vertex s and run Dijkstra’s algorithm for every vertex.
